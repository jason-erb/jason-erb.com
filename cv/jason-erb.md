#### **Om Language** | [https://github.com/sparist/om](https://github.com/sparist/Om)

Creator of the Om Language, an experimental high-level, concatenative, functional, homoiconic programming language, written in C++, with minimal syntax (only three elements), prefix notation (whereby functions manipulate the remainder of the program itself), and a single “program” data type.

#### **Om Tree** | [https://gitlab.com/impossibilium/om-tree](https://gitlab.com/impossibilium/om-tree)

Creator of the Om Tree, an efficient and robust (with [100% line, function, and branch unit test coverage](https://impossibilium.gitlab.io/om-tree/gcovr/index.html)) associative array written in modern, portable C17 as a binary compact prefix tree with novel optimizations that allow it to significantly outperform std::map on most operations.
